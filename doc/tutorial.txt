Getting Started
===============

In order to start using gladius, you will need to add a new script tag to your
web page:

<script src="gladius.js">

We should also make a canvas on the page:

<canvas id="test-canvas" width="320" height="240">
</canvas>

Once this script is loaded you will have access to the gladius object. Now you
should create an engine instance:

gladius.create(
	{
		services: {
			graphics: {
				src: 'graphics/service',
				options: {
					canvas: document.getElementById( "test-canvas" )
				}
			}
		}
	},
	game
);

Engine instances are constructed asynchronously and your callback, game, will
be invoked, with the engine instance as a parameter, when the engine is ready.
Your game callback function should look like this:

function game( engine ) {
  ...
}

Engine Instance
===============

Once you have access to an engine instance you can build the pieces of your
simulation.
